TODO-List:
--------------

character view:

-characterEdit is a bad name for the subcomponent
-undo and redo (state chain)

places view:

-character dropdown to add character at place FOR A SPECIFIC TIME!
-character overview to see characters present AT A SPECIFIC TIME!
-timeline to scroll through events for that place
-no characters in places view (but only in event view)
-[idea] slide left/right between some place images. 
-[idea] have some initial images (sketches?) as inspiration for a story...
-[idea] inspire me function: just show default set of landscape images on demand

event view:

-miniature timeline view of all events (scrollable? time slots?)
-click on other events switches to view of that event? or switches to timeline view?
-it should be impossible to create an event without a place reference (because an event without place is undefined)

-bug: findIndex to initially select the place this event happens at does not work. find out why (maybe some bug lead to identical ids for 2 places???)

timeline view:

-make it possible to sort all events of all places (or a defined group) in the timeline view
-give each event a free-text "time" field where a general time description (such as "monday morning") can be defineds

thumbnails loading:

-constraints for file selection -type: images, only one file
-rondell with example images

relationships view:

-shuld show what relationship characters share and where they met
-this could be relatedness, friendship, relationships...

general:

-module and layout concept?
-using Redux etc?
-relationship view
-drag&drop for preview images into the views (the placeholders can be customized by user)
-or add/select image-button: that allows to select/load an image file
-custom smaller components for code reuse and better reading

-List of references per view (e.g. character associated with place or places a character visits)
