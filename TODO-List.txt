TODO-List:
--------------

character view:

-characterEdit is a bad name for the subcomponent
-undo and redo (state chain)

places view:

-character dropdown to add character at place FOR A SPECIFIC TIME!
-character overview to see characters present AT A SPECIFIC TIME!
-timeline to scroll through events for that place
-[idea] slide left/right between some place images. 
-[idea] have some initial images (sketches?) as inspiration for a story...
-[idea] inspire me function: just show default set of landscape images on demand

event view:

-miniature timeline view of all events (scrollable? time slots?)
-click on other events switches to view of that event? or switches to timeline view?
-it should be impossible to create an event without a place reference (because an event without place is undefined)

timeline view:

-make it possible to sort all events of all places (or a defined group) in the timeline view
-give each event a free-text "time" field where a general time description (such as "monday morning") can be defineds

thumbnails loading:

-constraints for file selection -type: images, only one file
-rondell with example images

relationships view:

-shuld show what relationship characters share and where they met
-this could be relatedness, friendship, relationships...
-relationships of groups, relationshp graphs

relationship between places:

-paths between places: distance, mode of transportation, time it takes, places in-between

objects view:

-there are stories revolving about objects (think LOTR)
-objects can be in someone's posession, or they can be at a place

general:

-"do you really want to delete this" modal dialogs to make sure the user does not make unrevertable stuff

-module and layout concept?
-using Redux etc?
-drag&drop for preview images into the views (the placeholders can be customized by user)
-or add/select image-button: that allows to select/load an image file
-custom smaller components for code reuse and better reading
-female and other genders placeholder image

settings for customizing views:
-show list views as either lists or thumbnails (more compact)
-add additional tabs with information
