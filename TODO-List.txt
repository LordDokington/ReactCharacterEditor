places view:

-character dropdown to add character at place FOR A SPECIFIC TIME!

-no characters in places view (but only in event view)

-[idea] inspire me function: just show default set of landscape images on demand

event view:

-shows characters relevant for event
-shows place where the event takes place
-miniature timeline view of all events (scrollable? time slots?)
-click on other events switches to view of that event? or switches to timeline view?
